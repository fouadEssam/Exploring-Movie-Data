**Based on these steps, we perform our project:**
---



1. **Business Question**: We start by defining the questions we want to answer through insights. Examples of such questions include:
   - Top 10 Countries by Movie Count
   - Average IMDB Score by Genre
   - Average Profit by Genre
   - Comparison between Profit and Budget for Each Movie
   - Number of Movies Released by Year

2. **Get Data**: We obtain the necessary data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prmohanty/pandas-movie-dataset) <br>

3. **Explore Data**: In this step, we display the data's information and columns, and search for null values to ensure the quality of our data.

4. **Prepare Data**: We clean and transform the data to make it suitable for analysis. This includes:
   - Handling missing values (e.g., imputation or removal)
   - Removing duplicates
   - Correcting inconsistencies (e.g., standardizing formats)
   - Normalizing or scaling data if necessary

5. **Analyze Data**: We apply statistical methods to extract insights and answer the business questions. This can involve:
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Data visualization


6. **Present Findings**: Finally, we communicate the results of our analysis through reports, dashboards, or presentations. This step is crucial for making data-driven decisions.
